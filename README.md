#lucos Hello World


This is a simple web service written in bash.  It is not meant to provide any meaningful functionality, instead it serves as an example of a basic lucos service.  It can also be used for testing other parts of lucos infrastructure.

## Running

This should be run inside lucos_services.  Like other services, it can be run standalone, but there's really not much point in that.
